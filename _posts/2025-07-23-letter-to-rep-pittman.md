You voted as the only Democrat in favor of the HB-805 bill on June 25. Governor Stein vetoed it July 3 and it will soon be up for a vote again, possibly as soon as tomorrow.

This bill would strip insurance coverage for gender-affirming healthcare for all members of the state employee health plan (because the trigger condition in § 143C-6-5.6 Section 3(b) has already been met). There are approximately 750,000 North Carolinians on the state health plan. If governor Stein’s veto is overturned, these changes will take effect July 30.

The aim of § 143C-6-5.6 is purportedly to eliminate government spending “directly and indirectly” for gender-affirming healthcare, but does not include any language pertaining to the cost and contract negotiation between the state and the insurance company; therefore, the clause denying insurance coverage provides no actual promise of saving North Carolina any money. The most likely outcome is that the insurance company will save money.

The fact that this bill is concerned with “indirect” spending is transparently evil. This makes it clear that **the goal is not to reduce government spending, but to make North Carolina a hostile place for transgender people**. This clause overrules the opinions of medical professionals, causes significant harm to all transgender employees of North Carolina, and does not appear to have any benefit on North Carolina’s government, budget, or citizens; it serves only to oppress a specific group of people.

Many of your Republican colleagues have made it clear time and time again that they literally do not value the life of a transgender person, and that their goal is persecution. I am optimistic that you do not share this view, and that you were instead voting in favor of some of the other provisions in the bill which would provide reasonable protections for women and children.

The bill as it is written right now will cause very real financial and medical problems for innocent people. For no reason at all. The Republicans are one vote shy of a supermajority in the House, and I am urging you to use your vote to stand up with your Democratic colleagues against pointless persecution. Please vote against HB-805. Let the veto stand.
