title:  Eight Vetos Overturned in One Day. Humiliating.

In the last election, Democrats managed to prevent the Republicans from securing a super-majority by a *single* seat in the house. So, as long as the party presents a unified front and stands behind their Governor, they can prevent vetos from being overturned.

Yesterday the current chamber made their first attempt at overturning vetos. They put eight vetoed bills on the table, and managed to overturn every single one.

What a travesty.

[Rep. Cunningham](https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/642) (Mecklenburg) was first to break away, on immigration, voting in favor of a bill that requires law enforcement to assist ICE. Here is a [video](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article311509383.html) of the speech she gave immediately before her HB 318 vote, which was the first veto on the docket. Cunningham voted in favor of [SB 266](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/586), [SB 416](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/588), [SB 254](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/590), [HB 402](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/580), and [HB 318](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/578).

[Rep. Willingham](https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/700) (Bertie, Edgecombe, Martin) broke away over charter schools and gun laws, voting to allow private school teachers to carry concealed firearms in the classroom. Willingham voted in favor of [SB 266](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/586), [SB 416](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/588), [SB 254](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/590), [HB 402](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/580), [HB 193](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/576), and [HB 549](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/582).

[Rep. Majeed](https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/752) (Mecklenburg) was the sole defector on overturning HB 805. In explanation, he said "I had some moral issues and I had to lean on my values". Majeed voted in favor of [SB 266](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/586) and [HB 805](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/584).

[Rep. Brockman](https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/691) (Guilford) piled on too. Brockman voted in favor of [SB 416](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/588) and [SB 254](https://www.ncleg.gov/Legislation/Votes/RollCallVoteTranscript/2025/H/590).

Here is my attempt to summarize each bill that was made law yesterday. I'm focused on being concise, and some nuance may get lost. Please take each with a grain of salt, and click through to read more.

I'm not somebody who believes that a politician should always vote down party lines -- far from it -- but turning your back on your party during a veto vote in the current environment should be *unthinkable*. It shows that the Republicans are in full and absolute unchecked control of the government. It's a blank check to run free. You've rendered your entire party ineffective because you each disagree on one single issue. Show a little solidarity when it matters most. Shame on the four of you.
