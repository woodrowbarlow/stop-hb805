Representative Moreyâ€™s office requested for Legislative Analysis to look over my interpretation of the bill. They said that the SCOTUS vacating Kadel v. Folwell could NOT be interpreted as vacating the permanent injunction. While the passing of HB 805 (and other bills) represents a grim day for public education in NC, perhaps the Kadel v. Folwell review might preserve life-saving coverage.
